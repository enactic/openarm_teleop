  # Shared gains:
  # • Kp/Kd are shared between bilateral and unilateral control.
  # • Increasing Kp/Kd makes contact feel more "real" but also heavier.
  #
  # Friction model (tanh):
  #   τ_fric(ω) = Fo + Fv·ω + Fc·tanh(k·ω)
  #   Fc : Coulomb friction magnitude [Nm]
  #   k  : tanh steepness near zero velocity
  #   Fv : Viscous friction coefficient [Nm·s/rad]
  #   Fo : Constant bias/offset torque [Nm]
